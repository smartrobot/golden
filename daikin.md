# **Daikin Heating & Cooling in Phoenix**

### How often do you think about your home’s HVAC systems? If we had to guess, we’d say not all that often—at least not until the day your system doesn’t function properly. Then it becomes your number one priority because your family’s comfort is in jeopardy. When making decisions about your home’s heating or cooling system, there are two things you need to consider—the HVAC company that will be installing or repairing the system and the manufacturer. When you choose Daikin, you get both a reputable contractor and manufacturer automatically.

# **Daikin’s Inverter Technology**

### Sometimes your heating and cooling system needs help maintaining the climate in your home. Inverters adjust the power used to meet the actual requirement—no more, no less! This technology provides you with two major benefits:

+ ### **Comfort** – An inverter continuously adjusts its cooling and heating output to keep temperature at a comfortable level. As soon as the correct temperature is reached, the inverter ensures that it is constantly maintained.

+ ### **Energy efficient**– By continually monitoring and adjusting the ambient temperature, an inverter helps to reduce energy consumption by 30 percent!
